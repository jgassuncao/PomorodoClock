This application is a Pomodoro Clock :alarm_clock: from the [App Ideas Collection :ledger:](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Pomodoro-Clock.md).

It solves the following user stories:

* User can see a timer for 25 minutes - the working session
* After the working session is over, the User can see a timer for 5 minutes - the break session
* User can start / pause, stop and reset the timers
* User can hear a sound playing when the timer hits 00:00 - denoting that the session has ended
* User can change / customize the minutes in both sessions before starting

For this project I used React, Material UI, and Moment.js. In this project, I went deeper into the concepts of set state, use effect, and components. It was a little more challenging due to the use of set interval so that the clock could be decremented. 

If you want to run this application on your machine you'll need:

* **[Install Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
* **Run the application using npm start**
